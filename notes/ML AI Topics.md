## Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

1. There will always be true statements within that system that you can't prove using only those rules.
2. You can't prove that the set of rules itself is consistent (meaning it won't lead to contradictions) using only those same rules.

Essentially means that the axioms and statements within the system cannot be proved using only those set of rules themselves. It has to be outside of the system to be able to prove them.

### How it applies to AI:

**Limitations on Self-Verification:** The second part of Gödel's theorem states that a consistent formal system cannot prove its own consistency using only its own axioms. This raises questions about an AI's ability to truly understand its own limitations, biases, or potential for errors if it's based solely on a formal system. It can't have an internal "proof" that it will always function correctly.

**AI as Formal Systems:** Many early and even some current approaches to AI involve creating systems based on formal logic and mathematical rules. Think of expert systems or AI that tries to prove mathematical theorems. If an AI's core is built upon such a system, then Gödel's theorem suggests inherent limitations.

**Unprovable Truths:** Gödel showed that within any sufficiently complex and consistent formal system capable of expressing basic arithmetic, there will always be true statements that cannot be proven within that system itself. If an AI operates within such a framework, it might encounter truths it can't logically deduce or verify using its internal rules, even if those truths are "real."

### Potential ways of overcoming this:

**External Information and Interaction:** Gödel's theorem applies to closed formal systems. Humans and potentially advanced AIs interact with the real world, receiving new information and perspectives that lie outside any single formal system they might be using internally. This external input could potentially allow them to overcome some of the limitations described by the theorem.

**AI Isn't Just Formal Logic:** Modern AI, especially with the rise of machine learning and neural networks, isn't solely based on explicit formal systems. These systems learn from data and can exhibit complex behaviors that aren't directly programmed as a set of logical rules. It's not clear if Gödel's theorem directly applies to these more fluid, data-driven approaches
