To help the learner develop a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms, the following tutoring plan is outlined with an emphasis on visualization and backtracking techniques:

1. **Foundation Building (Week 1-2):**
    
    - Begin by reviewing essential concepts of algorithms and data structures using visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts.
    - Incorporate interactive platforms such as Visualgo and AlgoViz to allow the learner to visualize data structures in action.
    - Focus on basic data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Encourage the learner to draw each operation step-by-step on paper to solidify understanding.
2. **Exploring Advanced Data Structures (Week 3-4):**
    
    - Introduce more complex data structures such as trees, graphs, and hash tables. Use tree visualizers and BFS/DFS animations to aid in visualization.
    - Conduct hands-on sessions where the learner manually traces through algorithms like tree traversal and graph search, applying backtracking techniques.
    - Implement and visualize sorted arrays and binary search trees using coding exercises in Python or Java, enabling the learner to manipulate data structures programmatically.
3. **Algorithm Understanding Through Patterns (Week 5-6):**
    
    - Teach algorithm design patterns such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.
    - Guide the learner to tackle problems by recognizing these patterns and using appropriate backtracking steps to revert decisions and find alternatives.
    - Encourage participation in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, focusing on a single pattern each week.
4. **Problem-solving and Backtracking (Week 7-8):**
    
    - Introduce specific problems like the N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, and Knightâ€™s Tour to emphasize backtracking methods.
    - Create gradual exercises where the learner can solve each part of these problems visually and verify each step using debugging tools in IDEs.
    - Move from simpler exercises to more complex ones, with ample focus on the thought process behind reversing and re-exploring paths.
5. **Integration and Assessment (Week 9-10):**
    
    - Integrate learned concepts by focusing on real-world applications that combine multiple data structures and algorithms.
    - Conduct a mock project that requires planning, implementing, and visualizing a solution using learned techniques.
    - End with an assessment where learner must explain the reasoning and decision-making process behind chosen data structures and algorithms in solving a given problem.




I've been thinking about the current limitations of LLMs, like hallucination as it is built off of its autoregressive nature of predicting the next nature of tokens based off of its preceding token. Do you think
